## 🛠️ things i've built to stay sane (or lose it)

> we all start somewhere — here's mine.

### 🎓 CGPA Calculator — `C`
Terminal-based app to calculate semester GPA and total CGPA.  
🧮 Wrote it when my GPA felt like a mystery.  
☠️ Floating point errors made it worse.

### 🔐 Caesar Cipher — `C`
Classic encryption using character shifting — old-school and insecure, just like my trust issues.  
📜 Text-based CLI app for simple encryption/decryption.

### 🧮 matxlib — `C++` (in progress)
Matrix operations library (addition, multiplication, determinant, etc).  
🧱 WIP — still laying the bricks.  
🔧 Building a basic math lib from scratch for learning & practice.

[→ work in progress](https://github.com/manakcodes/matxlib-cpp.git)
